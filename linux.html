        <p>When I was a rising freshman back in 2021, my laptop was getting increasing slower, as the
        new school year was getting closer. This left me with three options:</p>
            <br>
            <br>1. Get a new laptop (still haven't)
            <br>2. Try to reduce bloat from my laptop
            <br>3. Try out Linux for the first time.
            <br>
            <br>Ultimately, I decided to pick the third option, as I was increasingly curious about Linux's
        potential, and its low resource usage. This led me to trying out <a class="a1" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>, one of Linux's many <a class="distro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions">distros</a>.
            <br>I chose it for many reasons, those being that it is decently beginner friendly,
                as in you can use the OS with comparatively little terminal usage.
        <br>This becomes an issue in distros like <a class="a2" href="https://archlinux.org">Arch</a>, which dissuades most would-be Linux users by its heavy terminal usage.
        and its uncompared level of customizabilty.
        <br>
        <br>On a fresh install of Fedora, you might be intimidated by how different it appears compared to Windows, although it is very simple in theory,
        with familiarities like the taskbar at the bottom (despite the options and notification center being at the top).
        <br>As Fedora is obviously a part of the Linux family, you can customize virtually every feature of the OS, a majority of people use this to make it more familiar,
        such as making the OS look more like MacOS or Windows. I personally wanted a more vanilla experience, so I kept it pretty close to standard.
        <br>This feature is something I wish there was more of on Windows 10 and 11 (I am still very angry that you can't move your taskbar location on 11!)
        As I find myself disliking certain stylistic choices made on Windows.
        <br>
        <br>Obviously the biggest feature of Linux is the command-line/Terminal, which over the past 2 years I have been using A LOT.
        <br>When I started out, I tried using the app store built in to install the programs I wanted with repositories, however, when I started using the terminal
        I realized how much quicker it is.
        <br>On Windows, It is typically a big hassle to download programs as you need to search the internet to find what you want to install.
        <br>However in Fedora,
        you can just use "dnf install (program name)" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">(In most other distros its "apt-get (program name)")</a> to automatically install the program you want, I became very used to this, and I still wish Windows had something similar to those package managers.)
        <br>
        <br>As of currently, I am actually using Windows 11 again on my laptop, not because I got tired of Fedora, but because of the compatibility issues I was having.
        <br>Since Linux distros combined make up <5% of the PC market space there simply isn't that wide of developer support. <br>
        I don't blame this on Linux or Fedora itself however,
        though frankly I am sad to not be using that familiar customizable OS anymore.
        <br>If anyone reading this has never tried out Linux before, I say give it a try! Most Linux distros have bootable iso's that you can use to try out the OS without installing it onto your main drive.


            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway, thank you for reading my ramblings about my love of Fedora Linux and my Hatred of Windows.
            <br>See you guys next time!
