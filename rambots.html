    <p>Although it was not required that I make a website for my High School's Robotics Club, I decided to do it anyway. I did this for multiple reasons,
    with those being:
        <br>
        <br>1. It would be a better place to keep all of our stuff located
        <br>2. It would greatly simplify our attendance, as we are currently using Google Docs to manually take attendance.
        <br>3. It would be a great first project for me to start on.
        <br>
        <br> Continuing with what I said on #3, this blog itself was based on that website, as I wanted a place to put my thoughts and projects.
        <br>Ultimately, I started as an absolute beginner at HTML and CSS, as I've didn't even touch those languages before starting the rambots.works website.
        <br>However, I was able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS in a couple of days, and was able to create a website that I am decently proud of as a beginner.
        <br> As such, this blog website will heavily change over the next few articles as I change a few things and learn more about HTML and CSS, I don't see this as
    a bad thing however! As this will allow me to improve the quality <br> as I learn. <br> <br>
    Back on the robot side of things, I will try to keep the other website maintained and updated as much as I can while we are building the robot, as we have to mainly focus
    on getting the robot ready for the FIRST Robotics Competition in March.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, this article won't be very long, as this is basically just an introductory page for myself and what this website is for.
    <br> Thank you for reading this page, and I hope to see you in the next one!
